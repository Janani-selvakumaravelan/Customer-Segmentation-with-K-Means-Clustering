# Customer-Segmentation-with-K-Means-Clustering
This project applies K-Means Clustering on customer data to identify distinct segments based on purchasing behavior. Using unsupervised learning, it preprocesses the dataset, scales features, and visualizes clusters to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer engagement.
This project uses K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. By applying unsupervised learning to the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset, we identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

Technologies Used
Python
K-Means Clustering (from Scikit-learn)
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Google Colab

Steps:
Dataset: The dataset is loaded from Kaggle using KaggleHub.
Preprocessing: Data cleaning and feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Clustering: Applied K-Means to identify customer segments.
Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization: Plotted clusters and visualized insights.

Results
The project segments customers into distinct clusters, providing valuable insights for businesses to target specific customer profiles.
